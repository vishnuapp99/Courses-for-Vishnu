# Behavioral Patterns

**Purpose:** Manage communication and responsibilities between objects

Behavioral patterns are the most important for real-world systems. They help objects communicate and work together efficiently.

## 📚 Patterns in This Category

### 🔥 Must Learn (High Priority):
1. [Strategy Pattern](./01-strategy.md) - Interchangeable algorithms
2. [Observer Pattern](./02-observer.md) - Event-driven communication
3. [Chain of Responsibility](./04-chain-of-responsibility.md) - Request handling chain

### 📚 Important (Medium Priority):
4. [State Pattern](./05-state.md) - Object behavior changes with state
5. [Command Pattern](./03-command.md) - Encapsulate requests
6. [Template Method Pattern](./06-template-method.md) - Define algorithm skeleton

### 📖 Advanced (Lower Priority):
7. [Mediator Pattern](./07-mediator.md) - Centralized communication
8. [Iterator Pattern](./08-iterator.md) - Traverse collections
9. [Memento Pattern](./09-memento.md) - Save/restore object state

## 🎯 When to Use Behavioral Patterns

Use behavioral patterns when:
- You need flexible communication between objects
- You want to reduce coupling
- You need to handle state changes
- You're working with algorithms that can vary
- You need to manage complex workflows

## 🚀 Learning Order

**Recommended:** Start with Strategy → Observer → Chain of Responsibility → State → Others
