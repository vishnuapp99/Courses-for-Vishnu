# Creational Patterns

**Purpose:** Control how objects are created

Creational patterns provide flexible ways to create objects, making your code more maintainable and scalable.

## 📚 Patterns in This Category

1. [Singleton Pattern](./01-singleton.md) - One instance only
2. [Factory Method Pattern](./02-factory-method.md) - Create objects without specifying exact class
3. [Abstract Factory Pattern](./03-abstract-factory.md) - Factory of factories
4. [Builder Pattern](./04-builder.md) - Step-by-step object construction
5. [Prototype Pattern](./05-prototype.md) - Clone existing objects

## 🎯 When to Use Creational Patterns

Use creational patterns when:
- Object creation is complex
- You need flexibility in object creation
- You want to avoid tight coupling
- You need to manage object lifecycle
- Creating objects requires special handling

## 🚀 Learning Order

**Recommended:** Start with Singleton → Factory → Builder → Others
