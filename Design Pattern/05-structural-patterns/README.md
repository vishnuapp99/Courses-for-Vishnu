# Structural Patterns

**Purpose:** Organize classes and objects into larger structures

Structural patterns help you compose objects and classes to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

## 📚 Patterns in This Category

1. [Adapter Pattern](./01-adapter.md) - Make incompatible interfaces work together
2. [Decorator Pattern](./02-decorator.md) - Add features dynamically
3. [Facade Pattern](./03-facade.md) - Simple interface over complex system
4. [Composite Pattern](./04-composite.md) - Tree structures (folders, menus)
5. [Proxy Pattern](./05-proxy.md) - Control access to objects

## 🎯 When to Use Structural Patterns

Use structural patterns when:
- You need to combine objects/classes
- You want to add functionality without modifying code
- You need to simplify complex interfaces
- You're working with incompatible interfaces
- You need to control access to objects

## 🚀 Learning Order

**Recommended:** Start with Adapter → Decorator → Facade → Others
